Description: Uses several NONMEM models (as NONMEM control files) to perform bootstrap model averaging 
    and Monte Carlo simulation for model based Model Based Bio-Equivalence (MBBE). Power is returned 
    as the fraction of the simulations with successful BE test, for Cmax, AUClast and AUCinf.
